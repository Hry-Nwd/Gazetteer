        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>After spending the past 5 years within the maritime industry, I felt that it was time to move forward with a career in
    IT as it is one of my biggest passions. I have spent the past few years travelling the world on some of the largest
    private superyachts, teaching their owners water sports and learning some great skills along the way. I am currently
    training to be a web developer via online training I am looking for a role in which I can break into the IT industry with
    a reputable company. I thrive when working in a team, but also enjoy using my initiative to problem solve
    independently when required. I am always keen to expand my knowledge base and I am constantly looking for ways
    to go above and beyond what is expected of me. </p>
